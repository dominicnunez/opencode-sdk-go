# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in this SDK, please report it responsibly by opening a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dominicnunez/opencode-sdk-go/issues) or contacting the maintainer directly.

For security issues related to the OpenCode platform itself, please follow [Anomaly Co's](https://anomaly.co) security reporting guidelines.

## Scope

This SDK communicates with a local or remote OpenCode server over HTTP. It does not handle authentication credentials directly — the OpenCode server manages auth. However, if you find issues related to request construction, response handling, or data exposure, please report them.

## Responsible Disclosure

Please allow reasonable time for investigation and remediation before public disclosure.
